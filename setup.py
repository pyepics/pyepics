long_desc = '''Python Interface to the Epics Channel Access protocol
of the Epics control system.   PyEpics provides 3 layers of access to
Channel Access (CA):
  1. a light wrapping of the CA C library calls, using ctypes. This
     provides a procedural CA library in which the user is expected
     to manage Channel IDs. It is mostly provided as a foundation
     upon which higher-level access is built.
  2. PV() (Process Variable) objects, which represent the basic object
     in CA, allowing one to keep a persistent connection to a remote
     Process Variable.
  3. A simple set of functions caget(), caput() and so on to mimic
     the CA command-line tools and give the simplest access to CA.

In addition, the library includes convenience classes to define
Devices -- collections of PVs that might represent an Epics Record
or physical device (say, a camera, amplifier, or power supply), and
to help write GUIs for CA.
