PyEpics Overview
============================================

The python :mod:`epics` package provides several function, modules, and
classes to interact with EPICS Channel Access.  The simplest approach uses
the functions :func:`caget`, :func:`caput`, and :func:`cainfo` within the
top-level `epics` module to get and put values of Epics Process Variables.
These functions are similar to the standard command line utilities and the
EZCA library interface, and are described in more detail below.

To use the :mod:`epics` package, import it with::

     import epics

The main components of this module include

    * functions :func:`caget`, :func:`caput`, :func:`cainfo` and others
      described in more detail below.
    * a :mod:`ca` module, providing the low-level library as a set of
      functions, meant to be very close to the C library for Channel Access.
    * a :class:`PV` object, representing a Process Variable (PV) and giving
      a higher-level interface to Epics Channel Access.
    * a :class:`Device` object: a collection of related PVs, similar to an
      Epics Record.
    * a :class:`Motor` object: a Device that represents an Epics Motor.
    * an :class:`Alarm` object, which can be used to set up notifications
      when a PV's values goes outside an acceptable bounds.
    * an :mod:`epics.wx` module that provides wxPython classes designed for
      use with Epics PVs.

If you're looking to write quick scripts or a simple introduction to using
Channel Access, the :func:`caget` and :func:`caput` functions are probably
where you want to start.

If you're building larger scripts and programs, using :class:`PV` objects
is recommended.  The :class:`PV` class provides a Process Variable (PV)
object that has methods (including :meth:`get` and :meth:`put`) to read and
change the PV, and attributes that are kept automatically synchronized with
the remote channel.  For larger applications where you find yourself
working with sets of related PVs, you may find the :class:`Device` class
helpful.

The lowest-level CA functionality is exposed in the :mod:`ca` module, and
companion :mod:`dbr` module.  While not necessary recommended for most use
cases, this module does provide a fairly complete wrapping of the basic
EPICS CA library.  For people who have used CA from C or other languages,
this module should be familiar and seem quite usable, if a little more
verbose and C-like than using PV objects.

In addition, the `epics` package contains more specialized modules for
alarms, Epics motors, and several other *devices* (collections of PVs), and
a set of wxPython widget classes for using EPICS PVs with wxPython.

The `epics` package is supported and well-tested on Linux, Mac OS X, and
Windows with Python versions 2.7, and 3.5 and above.


Quick Start
=================

Whether you're familiar with Epics Channel Access or not, start here.
You'll then be able to use Python's introspection tools and built-in help
system, and the rest of this document as a reference and for detailed
discussions.

Procedural Approach: caget(), caput()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get values from PVs, you can use the :func:`caget` function:

    >>> from epics import caget, caput, cainfo
    >>> m1 = caget('XXX:m1.VAL')
    >>> print(m1)
    1.2001

To set PV values, you can use the :func:`caput` function:

    >>> caput('XXX:m1.VAL', 1.90)
    >>> print(caget('XXX:m1.VAL'))
    1.9000

To see more detailed information about a PV, use the :func:`cainfo`
function:

    >>> cainfo('XXX:m1.VAL')
    == XXX:m1.VAL  (time_double) ==
       value      = 1.9
       char_value = '1.9000'
       count      = 1
       nelm       = 1
       type       = time_double
       units      = mm
       precision  = 4
       host       = somehost.aps.anl.gov:5064
       access     = read/write
       status     = 0
       severity   = 0
       timestamp  = 1513352940.872 (2017-12-15 09:49:00.87179)
       posixseconds        = 1513352940.0
       nanoseconds= 871788105
       upper_ctrl_limit    = 50.0
       lower_ctrl_limit    = -48.0
       upper_disp_limit    = 50.0
       lower_disp_limit    = -48.0
       upper_alarm_limit   = 0.0
       lower_alarm_limit   = 0.0
       upper_warning_limit = 0.0
       lower_warning_limit = 0.0
       PV is internally monitored, with 0 user-defined callbacks:
    =============================

The simplicity and clarity of these functions make them ideal for many
uses.

Creating and Using PV Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are repeatedly referencing the same PV, you may find it more
convenient to create a PV object and use it in a more object-oriented
manner.

    >>> from epics import PV
    >>> pv1 = PV('XXX:m1.VAL')

PV objects have several methods and attributes.  The most important methods
are  :meth:`get` and :meth:`put` to receive and send the PV's value, and
the :attr:`value` attribute which stores the current value.  In analogy to
the :func:`caget` and :func:`caput` examples above, the value of a PV can
be fetched either with

    >>> print(pv1.get())
    1.90

or

    >>> print(pv1.value)
    1.90

To set a PV's value, you can either use

    >>> pv1.put(1.9)

or assign the :attr:`value` attribute

    >>> pv1.value = 1.9

You can see a few of the most important properties of a PV by simply
printing it:

    >>> print(pv1)
    <PV 'XXX:m1.VAL', count=1, type=time_double, access=read/write>

More complete information can be seen by printing the PVs :attr:`info`
attribute::

    >>> print(pv1.info)
    == XXX:m1.VAL  (time_double) ==
       value      = 1.9
       char_value = '1.9000'
       count      = 1
       nelm       = 1
       type       = time_double
       units      = mm
       precision  = 4
       host       = somehost.aps.anl.gov:5064
       access     = read/write
       status     = 0
       severity   = 0
       timestamp  = 1513352940.872 (2017-12-15 09:49:00.87179)
       posixseconds        = 1513352940.0
       nanoseconds= 871788105
       upper_ctrl_limit    = 50.0
       lower_ctrl_limit    = -48.0
       upper_disp_limit    = 50.0
       lower_disp_limit    = -48.0
       upper_alarm_limit   = 0.0
       lower_alarm_limit   = 0.0
       upper_warning_limit = 0.0
       lower_warning_limit = 0.0
       PV is internally monitored, with 0 user-defined callbacks:
    =============================

PV objects have several additional methods related to monitoring changes to
the PV values or connection state including user-defined functions to be
run when the value changes.  There are also attributes associated with a
PVs *Control Attributes*, like those shown above in the :attr:`info`
attribute.  Further details are at :ref:`pv-label`.


Simple :mod:`epics` functions: caget(), caput(), etc.
========================================================================

.. module:: epics
   :synopsis: top-level epics module, and container for simplest CA functions

As shown above, the simplest interface to EPICS Channel Access is found
with the functions :func:`caget`, :func:`caput`, and :func:`cainfo`.  There
are also functions :func:`camonitor` and :func:`camonitor_clear` to setup
and clear a simple monitoring of changes to a PV.  These functions all take
the name of an Epics Process Variable (PV) as the first argument and are
similar to the EPICS command line utilities of the same names.

Internally, these functions keeps a cache of connected PV (in this case,
using `PV` objects) so that repeated use of a PV name will not actually
result in a new connection to the PV -- see :ref:`pv-cache-label` for more
details.  Thus, though the functionality is simple and straightforward, the
performance of using thes simple function can be quite good.  In addition,
there are also functions :func:`caget_many` and :func:`caput_many` for
getting and putting values for multiple PVs at a time.


:func:`caget`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autofunction:: caget

Note that the `timeout` argument sets the maximum time to wait for a
value to be fetched over the network.  If the timeout is exceeded,
:func:`caget` will return ``None``.  This might imply that the PV is
not actually available, but it might also mean that the data is large
or network slow enough that the data just hasn't been received yet,
but may show up later.

The `use_monitor` argument sets whether to rely on the monitors from the
underlying PV.  The default is ``True``, so that cached values will be
used.  Using ``False`` will make the each :func:`caget` explicitly ask the
value to be sent instead of relying on the automatic monitoring normally
used for persistent PVs.  This will make :func:`caget` act more like
command-line tools, and slightly less efficient than creating a PV and
getting values with it.  If performance is a concern, using monitors is
recommended.  For more details on making :func:`caget` more efficient, see
:ref:`pv-automonitor-label` and :ref:`advanced-get-timeouts-label`.

The `as_string` argument tells the function to return the **string
representation** of the value.  The details of the string representation
depends on the variable type of the PV.  For integer (short or long) and
string PVs, the string representation is pretty easy: 0 will become '0',
for example.  For float and doubles, the internal precision of the PV is
used to format the string value.  For enum types, the name of the enum
state is returned::

    >>> from epics import caget, caput, cainfo
    >>> print(caget('XXX:m1.VAL'))     # A double PV
    0.10000000000000001

    >>> print(caget('XXX:m1.DESC'))    # A string PV
    'Motor 1'
    >>> print(caget('XXX:m1.FOFF'))    # An Enum PV
    1

Adding the `as_string=True` argument always results in string being
returned, with the conversion method depending on the data type, for
example using the precision field of a double PV to determine how to format
the string, or using the names of the enumeration states for an enum PV::

    >>> print(caget('XXX:m1.VAL', as_string=True))
    '0.10000'

    >>> print(caget('XXX:m1.FOFF', as_string=True))
    'Frozen'

For integer or double array data from Epics waveform records, the regular
value will be a numpy array (or a python list if numpy is not installed).
The string representation will be something like '<array size=128,
type=int>' depending on the size and type of the waveform.  An array of
doubles might be::

    >>> print(caget('XXX:scan1.P1PA'))  # A Double Waveform
    array([-0.08      , -0.078     , -0.076     , ...,
        1.99599814, 1.99799919,  2.     ])

    >>> print(caget('XXX:scan1.P1PA', as_string=True))
    '<array size=2000, type=time_double>'

As an important special case CHAR waveform records will be turned to Python
strings when *as_string* is ``True``.  This is useful to work around the
low limit of the maximum length (40 characters!) of EPICS strings which has
inspired the fairly common usage of CHAR waveforms to represent longer
strings::

    >>> epics.caget('MyAD:TIFF1:FilePath')
    array([ 47, 104, 111, 109, 101,  47, 101, 112, 105,  99, 115,  47, 115,
            99, 114,  97, 116,  99, 104,  47,   0], dtype=uint8)
    >>> epics.caget('MyAD:TIFF1:FilePath', as_string=True)
    '/home/epics/scratch/'

Of course,character waveforms are not always used for long strings, but can
also hold byte array data, such as may come from some detectors and
devices.

:func:`caput`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autofunction:: caput



The optional `wait=True` argument tells the function to wait until the
processing completes.  This can be useful for PVs which take
significant time to complete, either because it causes a physical
device (motor, valve, etc) to move or because it triggers a complex
calculation or data processing sequence.  The `timeout` argument gives
the maximum time to wait, in seconds.  The function will return after
this (approximate) time even if the :func:`caput` has not completed.

This function returns 1 on success.  It will return ``None`` if the timeout
has been exceeded.

    >>> from epics import caget, caput, cainfo
    >>> caput('XXX:m1.VAL',2.30)
    1
    >>> caput('XXX:m1.VAL',-2.30, wait=True)
    ... waits a few seconds ...


:func:`cainfo`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autofunction:: cainfo


    >>> from epics import caget, caput, cainfo
    >>> cainfo('XXX.m1.VAL')
    == XXX:m1.VAL  (double) ==
       value      = 2.3
       char_value = 2.3000
       count      = 1
       units      = mm
       precision  = 4
       host       = xxx.aps.anl.gov:5064
       access     = read/write
       status     = 1
       severity   = 0
       timestamp  = 1265996455.417 (2010-Feb-12 11:40:55.417)
       upper_ctrl_limit    = 200.0
       lower_ctrl_limit    = -200.0
       upper_disp_limit    = 200.0
       lower_disp_limit    = -200.0
       upper_alarm_limit   = 0.0
       lower_alarm_limit   = 0.0
       upper_warning_limit = 0.0
       lower_warning       = 0.0
       PV is monitored internally
       no user callbacks defined.
    =============================

:func:`camonitor`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autofunction:: camonitor


This sets a simple "monitor" on the named PV, which will cause
*something* to be done each time the value changes.  By default the PV
name, time, and value will be printed out (to standard output) when
the value changes, but the action that actually happens can be
customized.

One can specify any function that can take a string as *writer*, such as
the :meth:`write` method of an open file that has been open for writing.
If left as ``None``, messages of changes will be sent to
:func:`sys.stdout.write`. For more complete control, one can specify a
*callback* function to be called on each change event.  This callback
should take keyword arguments for *pvname*, *value*, and *char_value*.  See
:ref:`pv-callbacks-label` for information on writing callback functions for
:func:`camonitor`.

    >>> from epics import camonitor
    >>> camonitor('XXX.m1.VAL')
    XXX.m1.VAL 2010-08-01 10:34:15.822452 1.3
    XXX.m1.VAL 2010-08-01 10:34:16.823233 1.2
    XXX.m1.VAL 2010-08-01 10:34:17.823233 1.1
    XXX.m1.VAL 2010-08-01 10:34:18.823233 1.0


:func:`camonitor_clear`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..  autofunction:: camonitor_clear


This simple example monitors a PV with :func:`camonitor` for while, with
changes being saved to a log file.   After a while, the monitor is cleared
and the log file is inspected::

   >>> import epics
   >>> fh = open('PV1.log','w')
   >>> epics.camonitor('XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL',writer=fh.write)
   >>> .... wait for changes ...
   >>> epics.camonitor_clear('XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL')
   >>> fh.close()
   >>> fh = open('PV1.log','r')
   >>> for i in fh.readlines(): print(i[:-1])
    XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL 2010-03-24 11:56:40.536946 -183.5035
    XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL 2010-03-24 11:56:41.536757 -183.6716
    XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL 2010-03-24 11:56:42.535568 -183.5112
    XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL 2010-03-24 11:56:43.535379 -183.5466
    XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL 2010-03-24 11:56:44.535191 -183.4890
    XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL 2010-03-24 11:56:45.535001 -183.5066
    XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL 2010-03-24 11:56:46.535813 -183.5085
    XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL 2010-03-24 11:56:47.536623 -183.5223
    XXX:DMM1Ch2_calc.VAL 2010-03-24 11:56:48.536434 -183.6832

:func:`caget_many`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..  autofunction:: caget_many

For more detailed information about the arguments, see the
documentation for :func:`caget`. Also see
:ref:`advanced-connecting-many-label` for more discussion.

:func:`caput_many`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..  autofunction:: caput_many

Because connections to channels normally connect very quickly (less than a
second), but processing a put may take a significant amount of time (due to
a physical device moving, or due to complex calculations or data processing
sequences), a separate timeout duration can be specified for connections and
processing puts.


Motivation and design concepts
================================================

There are other Python wrappings for Epics Channel Access, so it it useful
to outline the design goals for PyEpics. The motivations for PyEpics3
included:

   1) providing both low-level (C-like) and higher-level access (Python
      objects) to the EPICS Channel Access protocol.
   2) supporting as many features of Epics 3.14 and greater as possible,
      including preemptive callbacks and thread support.
   3) easy support and distribution for Windows and Unix-like systems.
   4) support for both Python 2 (now no longer supported) and Python 3.
   5) using Python's ctypes library.

The idea is to provide both a low-level interface to Epics Channel Access
(CA) that closely resembled the C interface to CA, and to build higher
level functionality and complex objects on top of that foundation.  The
Python ctypes library conveniently allows such direct wrapping of a shared
libraries, and requires no compiled code for the bridge between Python and
the CA library.  This makes it very easy to wrap essentially all of CA from
Python code, and support multiple platforms.  Since ctypes loads a shared
object library at runtime, the underlying CA library can be upgraded
without having to re-build the Python wrapper. The ctypes interface
provides the most reliable thread-safety available, as each call to the
underlying C library is automatically made thread-aware without explicit
code.  Finally, by avoiding the C API altogether, supporting both Python2
and Python3 is greatly simplified.

Status
==============

The PyEpics package is actively maintained, but the core library is
reasonably stable and ready to use in production code.  Features are being
added slowly, and testing is integrated into development so that the chance
of introducing bugs into existing codes is minimized.  The package is
targeted and tested to work on all supported versions of Python, currently
Python 3.6 and higher.
