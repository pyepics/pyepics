This folder contains several tests of the Epics Channel Access Module.

Almost all of these tests require a working set of Epics Channels to run.
These are all named in the pvnames.py module, which you will probably need
to customize to run these tests.

The tests are not (yet?) very automated, and the results should be
inspected for correctness.

Tests using "low level" channel access   
    ca_unittest1.py               a "unit test" test 
    ca_type_conversion.py
    ca_connection_callback.py
    ca_simpletest.py
    ca_subscribe.py
    ca_subscribe2.py

Tests using PV:

    pv_connection_callback.py
    pv_multiple_callbacks.py
