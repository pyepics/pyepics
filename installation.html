<h2>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The latest stable version of the pyepics package is 3.5.9 which can be
installed with:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pip</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">pyepics</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you’re using Anaconda Python, there are a few conda channels that
provide the latest versions, but the version on <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyepics/">PyPI</a> should be considered
the reference version.</p>
<p>PyEpics 3.5.9 works with Python version 3.10 and higher.  It may
still work with older versions of Python, but no testing or support is
available for these.  At this writing, automated testing is done with
versions 3.10 through 3.14 on 64-bit Linux, though Pyepics is
supported and regularly used on 64-bit Linux, 64-bit Windows, 64-bit
Mac OSX with both Intel and Arm processors.  PyEpics should also work
on Linux with ARM processors including raspberry Pi and may still work
on 32-bit Windows and Linux, though these systems are not tested
regularly.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites and Dependencies, Supported Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites-and-dependencies-supported-systems" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Pyepics requires the EPICS Channel Access library from Epics Base
Version 3.14.12 or higher.  Using Epics Base 7.0.4 or higher is
strongly recommended.  More specifically, pyepics needs only to be
able to find the shared libraries <em>libca</em> and <em>libCom</em> (<em>libca.so</em> and
<em>libCom.so</em> on Linux, <em>libca.dylib</em> and <em>libCom.dylib</em> on Mac OSX, or
<em>ca.dll</em> and <em>Com.dll</em> on Windows) from <em>Epics Base</em>.</p>
<p>For Linux64, Linux32, LinuxArm, Windows64, Windows32, Darwin64 (MacOS)
on x86-64, and Darwin64 (MacOS) on arm64, pre-built versions of
<em>libca</em> (and <em>libCom</em>) are provided with pyepics.  These will be
installed with the python packages directory and will used by
default. This means that you do not need to separately install Epics
base libraries or any other packages to use pyepics.  These libraries
have been built with 3.16.2 or 7.0.7 - further details are given in
the <cite>clibs</cite> folder of the source kit. For Epics experts who may want
to use their own versions the <em>libca</em> from Epics base, instructions
for how to do this are given below.</p>
<p>The Python <a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a> module is highly
recommended. and will be used to automatically convert between EPICS
waveforms and numpy arrays if available.</p>
<p>The <cite>autosave</cite> module requires the <cite>pyparsing</cite> package, which is widely
available and often installed by default with many Python distributions.
The <cite>wx</cite> module requires the <cite>wxPython</cite> package, and the <cite>qt</cite> module
requires <cite>PyQt</cite> or <cite>PySide</cite>.</p>

<section id="getting-started-setting-up-the-epics-environment">
<h2>Getting Started, Setting up the Epics Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started-setting-up-the-epics-environment" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Pyepics will find and load the Channel Access dynamic library
(<em>libca.so</em>, <em>libca.dylib</em>, or <em>ca.dll</em> depending on the system) at
runtime to do Channel Access communication.  As said above, for the
most commonly used operating systems and architectures, modern version
of these libraries are provided, and will be installed and used with
pyepics by default.  We recommend using these.</p>
<p>If these provided versions of <em>libca</em> do not work for you, please let
us know.  If you need to or wish to use a different version of
<em>libca</em>, you can set the environmental variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PYEPICS_LIBCA</span></code> to
the full path of the dynamic library to use as <em>libca</em>, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">export</span> <span class="n">PYEPICS_LIBCA</span><span class="o">=/</span><span class="n">usr</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">local</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">epics</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">base</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">7.0.4</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">lib</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">linux</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">x86_64</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">libca</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">so</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that <em>libca</em> will need to find the library <em>libCom</em>, also created
with Epics Base. This is almost always in the same folder as <em>libca</em>
and can be found without trouble, but you may need to make sure that
the <em>libca</em> you are pointing to can find the required <em>libCom</em>.</p>
<p>To find out which CA library will be used by pyepics, use:</p>
<div class="doctest highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">epics</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">epics</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ca</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_libca</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which will print out the full path of the CA dynamic library that will be used.</p>
<p>With the Epics CA library loaded, you will also need to be able to
connect to Epics Process Variables. Generally, these variables are
provided by Epics I/O controllers (IOCs) that are processes running on
some device on the network.  If you are connecting to PVs provided by
IOCs on your local subnet, you should have no trouble.  If you are
trying to reach IOCs outside of your immediate subnet, you may need to
set the environmental variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST</span></code> to specify which
networks to search for PVs.  Consult your local Epics expert if you
are having trouble connecting to PVs that you think should be reachable.</p>
</section>
<section id="testing">
<h2>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Automated testing of PyEpics is done with the Github actions, for
Python 3.10 through 3.14, using an ubuntu-linux environment.</p>
<p>To run these tests yourself, you will need the <cite>pytest</cite> python
module. You will also need to run an Epics softIOC as a separate
process, and a simulator that updates PV values as a separate process.
These can all run on the same machine or different machines on your
network as long as all processes can see all the PVs (all using a
prefix of <cite>PyTest:</cite>).  The softIoc cannot be run in a separate
terminal process or using the <cite>procServ</cite> program.  To setup the
testing environment, first start the testing softIoc in one shell,
with:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">~&gt;</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">tests</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Setup</span>
<span class="o">~&gt;</span> <span class="n">softIoc</span> <span class="o">./</span><span class="n">st</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cmd</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you have <cite>procServ</cite> installed, you can do:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">~&gt;</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">tests</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Setup</span>
<span class="o">~&gt;</span> <span class="n">bash</span> <span class="o">./</span><span class="n">start_ioc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sh</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which will put the IOC properly as a background process. Second, run the
simulator (also in <cite>tests/Setup</cite>) so that Epics channels are changing:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">~&gt;</span> <span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">simulator</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Again, these do not have to be run on the same machine as your tests, but
the PVs here will need to be discoverable by all the processes involved.</p>
<p>Now, you are ready to run the tests in the <cite>tests</cite> folder.  In many
scenarios for Python libraries, one would be able to run all the tests, and
measure the testing coverage with a single command.  Because the pyepics
test will change underlying threading contexts, a simple</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">~&gt;</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">..</span>
<span class="o">~&gt;</span> <span class="n">pytest</span> <span class="n">test_</span><span class="o">*.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>will show many failures.  Instead you should run each test as a separate
run of <cite>pytest</cite>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>~&gt; for testfile in test_*.py; do  pytest $testfile ; done
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The automated testing process also uses the <cite>coverage</cite> tool to help
identify which parts of the code is actually run by the tests.
Unfortunately, the code for using GUI are not easily tested by the
automated procedures.  In addition, a softIoc would need to support all of
the subclasses of Device, which cannot be guaranteed.</p>
