    put a value to an epics Process Variable (PV).

    Parameters
    ----------
     pvname : str
         name of PV
     value : object
         value to put to PV (see notes)
     wait : bool, optional
         whether to wait for processing to complete [False]
     timeout : float, optional
         maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the processing to complete [60]
     connection_timeout : float, optional
         maximum time (in seconds) to wait for connection [5]

    Returns
    -------
    int or ``None``
      - 1  on succesful completion
      - -1 or other negative value on failure of the low-level CA put.
      - None  on a failure to connect to the PV.

    Notes
    -----
    1. Epics PVs are typically limited to an appropriate Epics data type,
       int, float, str, and enums or homogeneously typed lists or arrays.
       Numpy arrays or Python strings are generally coeced as appropriate,
       but care may be needed when mapping Python objects to Epics PV values.
    2. If not already connected, the PV will first attempt to connect to
       the networked variable. As the initial connection can take some time
       (typically 30 msec or so), if a successful connection is made, a rich
       PV object with will be stored internally for later use.  Use
       connection_timeout to control how long to wait before declaring that
       the PV cannot be connected (mispelled name, inactive IOC, improper
       network configuration)
    3. Since some PVs can take a long time to process (perhaps physically
       moving a motor or telling a detector to collect and not return until
       done), it is impossible to tell what a "reasonable" timeout for a put
       should be.

    Examples
    --------
    to put a value to a PV and return as soon as possible:

    >>> caput('xx.VAL', 3.0)

    to wait for processing to finish, use 'wait=True':

    >>> caput('xx.VAL', 3.0, wait=True)

    Notes
    -----
    1. If not already connected, the PV will first attempt to connect to
       the networked variable. As the initial connection can take some time
       (typically 30 msec or so), if a successful connection is made, a rich
       PV object with will be stored internally for later use.
    2. `as_string=True` will return a string: float values will formatted
       according to the PVs precision, enum values will return the approriate
       enum string, etc.
    3. `use_monitor=True` will return the most recently cached value from the
       internal monitor placed on the PV. This will be the latest value unless
       the value is changing very rapidly. `use_monitor=False` will ignore the
       cached value and ask for an explicit value.  Of course, if a PV is
       changing rapidly enough for that to make a difference, it may also
       change between getting the value and downstream code using it.

    Examples
    --------
    to get the value of a PV:

    >>> x = caget('xx.VAL')

    to get the character string representation (formatted double, enum string, etc):

    >>> x = caget('xx.VAL', as_string=True)

    to get a truncated amount of data from an array, you can specify the count:

    >>> x = caget('MyArray.VAL', count=1000)

    Notes
    -----
    1. To write the result to a file, provide the `writer` option, such as a write
       method to an open file or some other callable that accepts a string.
    2. To completely control where the output goes, provide a `callback`
       method and you can do whatever you'd like with them.  This callback will be
       sent keyword arguments for pvname, value, char_value, and more. Use `**kws`!
    3. `monitor_delta` will set a value below which changes in the PV value
       will not generate an event.  This will try to set the `MDEL` field for
       a PV, limiting events from being sent from the PV server.  If MDEL
       cannot be set (perhaps due to write-access), this will be simulated in the
       client code. The default `None` will leave the current value unchanged.
