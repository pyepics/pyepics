	* Version 3.0.10:

 	- improved devices to use attributes in addition to get()/put()
	methods, so that
	   a = device('XX:m1', delim='.')
	   print a.VAL
	is equivalent to  print a.get('VAL').  Case is preserved, and
	device.get(attr, as_string=True) is still the only way to get
	the string representation.

	- several improvements to Motor and MotorPanel to use this new
	device interface.

	- synchronous groupns now work.

	- epicsPV now works correctly.

	- added a 'count=' argument to ca.get() and PV.get() to limit
	(really!) the number of array elements fetched for array data.

	- fixed bug in handling very large char waveform for images.

	- better coverage and testing

	* Version 3.0.9:
 	- many fixes to ca.py to avoid errors on 64-bit linux (no other 
	64-bit systems available for testing at this time).  Two separat
	errors were found:
	-- incorrect mapping of "DBR_LONG" (should be	ctypes.c_int) 
	-- use of args.chid as a Channel ID in 'connection' and 'get'
	callbacks:  The issue is that the Python callback receives
	args.chid as a Python int, and this must be cast to a
	dbr.chid_t (a ctypes.c_long) for use by any ca function.
	Oddly, using the Python int worked on 32 bit systems.

	- simplified approach to reconnection attempts for un-connected
	channels.  The "force" keyword has been eliminated (it never
	really forced a connection, just retried).

	- fixed bug that prevented getting array data on systems without
	numpy installed. 
	
	- added tests, tested on more systems with more variations.

	* Version 3.0.8:
 	- fixed fetching of ctrl and time variants of array data, due
	to a patch from Glen Wright (<Glen.Wright@lightsource.ca>)!

	- improvement for connections on slow networks: 
	moved setting of monitor reference to pv.on_connect, and
	postponing setting self.connection until pv.on_connect is
	complete.  This prevents a main thread from seeing
	self.connected = True and plowing ahead while the connection
	callback is still being run.  Connections are now much
	more reliable over slow networks (say, over a VPN and DSL 
	line from home -- it works!)

	- set EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES to 2**24 if not already set.
	
	- many fixes to wx.MotorPanel and related GUI components, so 
	that scripts/wx_motor.py now works much better.

	- small improvements to motor device.

	- added replace_printf_hanlder to ca.py: having difficulty with
	"fork a daemon process" with ca library.

	- doc improvements and updates

	* Version 3.0.7:
	- improved connection speed when connecting to many PVs
	(especially if some are not connected)

	- improved reliability of get(as_string=True) actually returning
	the "proper" string value of the PV (enum name, doubles formatted
	according to precision field, etc).

	- added CA Severity Exception, which is then ignored pend_io, so
	as to avoid unnecessary crashes.

	- added several tests.
	
	- documentation improvements

	* Version 3.0.6:
	- added working connection callbacks for PVs: users supply 
	a function that is called on changes to connection status.

2010-05-25  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 3.0.5:
	- set EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES to 2**31 prior to loading the
  	libca DLL, if EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES is not already set.

	- use ca.AUTOMONITOR_MAXLENGTH (default = 16384) to improve
	performance for large array / waveform data, in two ways:
	   1. a PV with an element count > ca.AUTOMONITOR_MAXLENGTH will
	NOT be automatically monitored, so that explicit get() calls are
	needed.  To override this,  use  auto_monitor=True when creating
	the PV.  Smaller arrays will still be automatically monitored
	(which can be turned off with auto_monitor=False).  This does not
	have a direct impact on the ca interface.

	  2.  PVs and ca channels with element count >
	ca.AUTOMONITOR_MAXLENGTH will NOT be implicitly converted to numpy
	arrays unless explicitly asked for with get(..., as_numpy=True).

	- fixed PV's char_value field in info paragraph, especially for
	"fresh" PVs where the precision value may not have been correctly
	fetched when info is called.

	* Version 3.0.4:
	fixed some performance bottlenecks for large arrays, as from
	areaDetector.

	* Version 3.0.3:
	fixed some threading issues

2010-04-20  Matt Newville  <newville@cars.uchicago.edu>

	* Version 3.0.2:

	- improved method to "locate CA dll" (or .so or .dylib) at run
	time, using ctypes.util.find_lib().  On Unix (including linux, Mac
	OSX), if the "usual system approach" of finding a DLL is not
	successful, the enviroment variables PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH (and
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OSX) will be searched for the appropriate
	DLL.
		
	- improved functionality for Python Threads.   The _cache data in
	ca.py now stores Channel IDs with CA "context", so that use of
	Python threads (as from threading.Thread) work, allowing, gets(),
	puts(), and callbacks in separately running threads.

	* Version 3.0.1:
	inital release of version 3.0.1 

	This is a dramatic change from the 2.1 series.  Please consult
	documentation.
